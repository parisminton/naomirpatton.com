          <p class="summary">I chronicled insurance redlining in Milwaukee's central city. I helped develop national campaigns and website content for Washington, D.C.-based professional and trade associations. I worked on the editing team for a book on the history of the Harley-Davidson company. I stood in Metro Airport, December 25, 2009, for hours until federal agents left after apprehending a would-be terrorist who tried to blow up a commercial flight with explosives in his underwear.</p>
          <p class="summary" style="margin-top: 20px;">Reporter. Staff Writer. Content Producer.  The titles change. The platforms evolve. The storytelling is constant.</p>
